 * is required to directly change the array itself.

 /**
 * @brief Sort array DESC
 *
 * The actual core of the statistics program. This function sorts the values
 * of the array using the bubble sort. Though not the efficient of the sorting
 * methods with a runtime of O(n^2), it is relatively simple to implement.
 *
 * Two values are being compared by each other and in case the bigger value is
 * not on the earlier position, they get swapped (since the module demands a
 * descending order, with means the bigger values are first). 
 *
 * In order to swap the values, a helper variable "temp_val" is being used to
 * temporarily store the value of the right value, to be then rewritten after
 * the actual swap.
 *
 * @param input_array given array to be evaluated
 * @param length length of array to be evaluated
